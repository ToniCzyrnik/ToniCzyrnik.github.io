Updated November 19th, 2022; from Aachen, Germany.

## Studying 📚

I'm waiting for my final approval for an exchange semester in Taiwan in February 2023. 🇹🇼 Unfortunately, I won't be able to take exams this semester in Aachen. Our exam period is between February and April for the winter semester. 

## Work life 

I started an internship at Miele in Gütersloh in the Smart Home Department. Many of my colleagues are young and super motivated to integrate innovations into the Miele product lines. I work on glucose monitoring and a coffee bean recognition. ☕️

## IT4Kids 🧑‍🏫

We are working on accelerating the digital transformation of the German education system. I currently work on expanding our location in Ulm, Germany.

## Reading 🤓

I discovered the books by [Derek Sivers](https://sive.rs). The books are a fast read. Insightful! 

## Fitness 💪

During my expedition on the Kungsleden, I lost about 10 % of my body weight. The majority was fat. But I'd like to gain muscle in the upcoming weeks. Getting into a new workout routine besides swimming and running is a challenge. **Important**: I need to focus on sufficient calories!

## What's next? 🔮

I don't have any plans for January yet - let's see about it. Starting in February, I'll be in Taipeh. Super hyped for my semester at Taiwan Tech! 🚀
