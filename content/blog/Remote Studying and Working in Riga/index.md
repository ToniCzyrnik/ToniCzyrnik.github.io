## Public Transport

I used the public transport to get to the city after I arrived at the airport. Super easy, super affordable, there's a tram line which connects the city with the airport. You can buy your ticket as a QR code. These QR codes are scanned at front entry of the tram or bus. All the transport is free for residents though. Theirs smart card functions as validation.

## Vegan Community

I was surprised by the many options for vegans in the city. My favourite restaurant is the [VEGAN RESTORAN V](https://www.veganrestoran.ee/en). They have small place in the centre of Old Town. Their menu is suitable for everyone, you'll find something. The self-made cakes and smoothies are as tasty as the main courses. Full recommendation. üòç
