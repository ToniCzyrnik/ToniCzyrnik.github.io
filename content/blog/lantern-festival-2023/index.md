The Shifen Lantern Festival is a part of the larger Taipei Lantern Festival and takes place annually in the small town of Shifen, Taiwan. The highlight of the festival is the release of sky lanterns, made of paper with a candle or fuel cell inside, which rise into the sky after participants write their wishes on them. The release of sky lanterns is a breathtaking sight, with the sky filled with floating lanterns of different colors and sizes. The festival attracts thousands of visitors each year. It is a celebration of local culture and a time for families and friends to come together.
