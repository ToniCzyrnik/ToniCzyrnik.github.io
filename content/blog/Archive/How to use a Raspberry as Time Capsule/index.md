## Setup Raspberry Pi

If you want to read about our basic Raspberry Setup: [Here you go!](https://czyrnik.me/blog/how-to-set-up-a-raspberry-pi/)
	
## Prepare the external drive

The most important thing is going to be your connected hard drive. We need a drive that uses HFS+ or APFS. Otherwise, we cannot use it for Time Machine. Currently, there's only a reliable read-only version for APFS on Linux. So, we are going to use HFS+ instead. 

Please make sure you format your drive correctly and do not forget to give read and write permissions to everyone using "Get Info" on your Mac.

## Mounting our Hard Drive

After we connected your drive to the Pi, we need to mount it. Otherwise we cannot access it. The Format HFS+ is not native to Linux. So, we need to install it.

	sudo apt-get install hfsprogs

After installing it, we need to find the name of our drive.
	
	lsblk -f

The name of my drive is "sda2". You'll find yours looking at the format and the size.

Format

	sudo mkfs -t ext4 /dev/sda2

### Creating a Mount Point

Before mounting a drive, we'll need a mount point! Let's create a directory. You can choose the path to your point as you like. I chose "/TM".

	sudo mkdir -p /TM

Unfortunately, the drive is not yet mounted permanently. Let's do that! Let's find the "PARTUUID" of your drive fist. 

	lsblk -f

You find further information with:

	sudo blkid /dev/sda
	
Let's open the following:

	sudo nano /etc/fstab

Add this line with your UUID to the bottom of the file.

	UUID=200d1fa5-78c3-4cc4-adb9-0de4f8776f2a  /TM  ext4  defaults  0  0

You check everything with
	
	sudo mount -a

Now, your drive will be mounted after every boot of the Pi! ðŸ¤¯

## Preparing everything for Time Machine

Before the can access the drive from our Mac, we need couple of additional tweaks.

### Installing Samba and Avahi

Samba is used for the file server. 

Avahi emulates a Time Capsule and our drive get's automatically discovered by MacOS. ðŸ”Ž

Let's install everything on our Raspberry Pi.

	sudo apt-get install samba avahi-daemon

### Creating a new user on the Pi

Let's add a user "timemachine" for dealing with all our Time Machine stuff! 

	sudo adduser timemachine

After creating the user, you'll be prompted to enter a password for the new user on your Raspberry Pi.

#### Give permission to the drive

This new user needs permission to write to the timemachine drive.

	sudo chown -R timemachine /TM

### Configurating Samba

We need to define a password for Samba. I used the same password for convenience.

	sudo smbpasswd -a timemachine

The need to define same details for Samba. "Time Machine" will be the name for our server. 

	sudo nano /etc/samba/smb.conf

Add these lines to end of the file:

	[Time Machine]
		comment = Backups
		path = /TM
		valid users = timemachine
		read only = no
		vfs objects = catia fruit streams_xattr
		fruit:time machine = yes
 
The changes will be affective after reloading Samba!

	sudo service smbd reload

### Configurating Avahi

Almost done! ðŸ™‚

We need to configure Avahi. Lets open the following file:

	sudo nano /etc/avahi/services/samba.service

The need to copy all the following into this file:

	<?xml version="1.0" standalone='no'?><!--*-nxml-*-->
	<!DOCTYPE service-group SYSTEM "avahi-service.dtd">
	<service-group>
	  <name replace-wildcards="yes">%h</name>
	  <service>
	    <type>_smb._tcp</type>
	    <port>445</port>
	  </service>
	  <service>
	    <type>_device-info._tcp</type>
	    <port>9</port>
	    <txt-record>model=TimeCapsule8,119</txt-record>
	  </service>
	  <service>
	    <type>_adisk._tcp</type>
	    <port>9</port>
	    <txt-record>dk0=adVN=Time Machine,adVF=0x82</txt-record>
	    <txt-record>sys=adVF=0x100</txt-record>
	  </service>
	</service-group>

Let's reload the service, so the changes will be affective:

	sudo service avahi-daemon reload

Now, your raspberry should be recognized as a Time Capsule!

![Show what you got!](./time_capsule.png)

Time Machine, here I come! ðŸš€

## Configuration Time Machine

Your drive should now be detected by the Time Machine. 

![Safety First!](./time_machine.png)

Do not forget to encrypt your backups!

![pwnd](./connect.png)

You can use the user "timemachine" and the Samba password you chose earlier.

## Conclusion

We've seen how to emulate a Time Capsule using a Raspberry Pi. Due to the small size of the Raspberry Pi, it's a very portable backup solution, which can be taken everywhere!
