&lt;p&gt;Imagine a future where the vastness of the ocean becomes the fountain of our clean energy needs. Welcome to the cutting edge of seawater splitting — a revolutionary process poised to unlock an endless supply of hydrogen fuel.
Dive with me into the deep blue as we explore how this remarkable technology could turn the tides on energy crises and solve the world&amp;rsquo;s thirst for sustainable power! 🌊&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;water-splitting&#34;&gt;Water Splitting
&lt;span&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#water-splitting&#34;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Seawater splitting &lt;em&gt;or seawater electrolysis&lt;/em&gt;, is the process of separating water  \(H_2O\) into its elements, hydrogen \(H_2\) and oxygen \(O_2\), through the application of electrical energy.
In our case, hydrogen is the element we are interested in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-problem-with-freshwater-earths-water-distribution&#34;&gt;The Problem with Freshwater: Earth&amp;rsquo;s Water Distribution
&lt;span&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#the-problem-with-freshwater-earths-water-distribution&#34;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;About 96.5 % of earth&amp;rsquo;s water is stored in its oceans as seawater.
Additionally, there&amp;rsquo;s about 1 % saline groundwater.
A small fraction of about 2.5 % is freshwater.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The majority of freshwater is locked up in glaciers and ice caps, accounting for nearly 69 % of it.
The remainder is groundwater (30 %) and surface freshwater like lakes and rivers (1 %).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;span&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#hydrogen-in-sun-rich--arid-regions&#34;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The production of hydrogen through the electrolysis with freshwater poses a sustainability challenge in sun-rich but arid regions.
The process could exacerbate water scarcity by diverting freshwater from human, agricultural, and ecological needs. 🌵&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;

	&lt;figcaption&gt;Imaginary sun-rich region&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Innovations like direct seawater electrolysis and the use of treated wastewater are under research.
Integrating hydrogen production with desalination plants could offer an alternative, although it increases energy consumption and decrease efficiency.
Sustainable hydrogen production in these areas requires careful resource management and the development of technologies that minimize freshwater use.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;composition-of-seawater&#34;&gt;Composition of Seawater
&lt;span&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#composition-of-seawater&#34;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Seawater&amp;rsquo;s unique composition presents both opportunities and challenges for water splitting applications.
The salts affect the durability and efficiency of electrolysis by catalyzing competing side reactions.
Furthermore, these salts may react with the electrodes, creating deposits that can block the electrode surfaces and impede the reaction.
Additionally, the pH of seawater (around 8) is lower than desired for current water splitting technologies, which can lowers the efficiency and output of hydrogen generation. &lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:1&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;chemical-reactions-oer--cler&#34;&gt;Chemical Reactions: OER &amp;amp; ClER
&lt;span&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#chemical-reactions-oer--cler&#34;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Oxygen Evolution Reaction (OER) and the Chlorine Evolution Reaction (ClER) are two competing electrochemical reactions that can occur during the electrolysis of chloride-containing solutions, such as seawater.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;oer&#34;&gt;OER
&lt;span&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#oer&#34;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;OER is the desirable half-reaction in the water-splitting process, where water molecules are oxidized to produce oxygen gas, protons, and electrons.
The overall reaction at the anode can be represented as:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;$$2 \mathrm{H}_2 \mathrm{O}(l) \rightarrow \mathrm{O}_2(g)+4 H^{+}(a q)+4 e^{-}$$&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This reaction has a standard potential of +1.23 V versus the Normal Hydrogen Electrode (NHE).
However, a higher potential is required due to kinetic overpotentials.
Usually, an overpotential of +2.00 V versus NHE is prefereable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;chlorine-evolution-reaction-cler&#34;&gt;Chlorine Evolution Reaction (ClER)
&lt;span&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#chlorine-evolution-reaction-cler&#34;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;In ClER, chloride ions \(Cl-\) are oxidized to form chlorine gas \(Cl_2\) at the anode.
This reaction can occur in chloride-rich solutions like seawater and is represented by:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;$$2 C l^{-}(a q) \rightarrow C l_2(g)+2 e^{-}$$&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The standard potential for this reaction is +1.36 V versus NHE.
ClER is kinetically favored in chloride-containing solutions compared to OER. &lt;sup id=&#34;fnref1:1&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;competition-between-oer-and-cler&#34;&gt;Competition between OER and ClER
&lt;span&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#competition-between-oer-and-cler&#34;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;During the electrolysis of chloride-rich solutions like seawater, the Oxygen Evolution Reaction (OER) is challenged by the Chlorine Evolution Reaction (ClER).
OER, which splits water to produce oxygen, is less energetically favorable and requires higher potentials than ClER, which generates chlorine gas from chloride ions and tends to occur more readily. &lt;sup id=&#34;fnref2:1&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;

	&lt;figcaption&gt;Conditions for OER&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This rivalry not only lowers the efficiency of hydrogen production by favoring chlorine gas release but also risks contaminating the oxygen produced, degrading electrodes more quickly, and forming undesirable and potentially harmful chlorinated compounds. &lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:2&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:2&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-problem-with-chlorine&#34;&gt;The problem with Chlorine
&lt;span&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#the-problem-with-chlorine&#34;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Preferring the Chlorine Evolution Reaction (ClER) during electrolysis not advisable due to several reasons tied to chlorine&amp;rsquo;s production, demand, and associated costs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chlorine is a reactive and hazardous gas, which poses significant risks in handling and transportation.
Due to its dangers, chlorine is typically produced on-site where it is needed for industrial processes.
According to the Eurochlor 2012 annual review, a small fraction (5-6%) of chlorine demand in Europe involves transportation.
Transporting chlorine, whether by road, rail, or pipeline, involves strict regulations, specialized equipment, and robust safety protocols to prevent leaks and exposure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
	&lt;img src=&#34;./skull.png&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; height=auto width=&#34;200&#34;/&gt;
	&lt;figcaption&gt;Chlorine is toxic.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Consequently, from an economic and safety perspective, minimizing the production of chlorine through ClER in favor of the Oxygen Evolution Reaction (OER) during electrolysis is preferred.
This approach aligns with the larger goal of sustainable and environmentally friendly hydrogen production, where the risks and costs associated with chlorine can be avoided.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;solutions-for-seawater-electrolysis&#34;&gt;Solutions for Seawater Electrolysis
&lt;span&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#solutions-for-seawater-electrolysis&#34;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ensuring the predominance of the Oxygen Evolution Reaction (OER) over the Chlorine Evolution Reaction (ClER) in seawater electrolysis can be achieved through strategies that exclude chlorine from the reaction.
Employing electrocatalysts that lower the activation energy required for OER can make it more energetically competitive, reducing the window in which ClER can occur.
Additionally, designing selective membrane systems or modifying the electrolyte composition to physically or chemically inhibit chlorine ions from reaching the anode can minimize or prevent the occurrence of ClER.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;option-1-reducing-the-needed-overpotential-with-electrocatalysts&#34;&gt;Option 1: Reducing the needed Overpotential with Electrocatalysts
&lt;span&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#option-1-reducing-the-needed-overpotential-with-electrocatalysts&#34;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The overpotential for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is a critical parameter when evaluating the efficiency of electrocatalysts used for water splitting.
It is the extra voltage above the thermodynamic potential required to drive the OER at a certain current density.
A lower overpotential indicates a more efficient electrocatalyst, as less energy is wasted in the form of heat and other losses like side reactions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
	&lt;img src=&#34;./arrow.png&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; height=auto width=&#34;200&#34;/&gt;
	&lt;figcaption&gt;Reducing overpotential ensures OER.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Research is looking for efficient catalysts with a high current density at low overpotentials. One research group finds Nitrogen-doped nickel molybdenum phosphide \(N-NiMo_3P\) as effective electrocatalysts for seawater splitting, showing lower overpotentials compared to commercial options and undoped counterparts. &lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:3&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:3&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;\(N-NiMo_3P\) achieved an overpotential of 35 mV to reach a current density of 10 mA/cm² in seawater, outperforming commercial Pt/C which required 73.5 mV, and undoped \(NiMo_3P\) which required 73 mV under the same conditions.
This performance is attributed to the nitrogen doping, which enhances the electrocatalytic activity by improving the catalyst&amp;rsquo;s electrical conductivity and increasing the density of active sites for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). &lt;sup id=&#34;fnref1:3&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:3&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;span&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#option-2-protecting-the-anode-from-chlorine&#34;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Excluding chlorine from the anode reaction in seawater electrolysis can be achieved through anode coating and the use of selective membranes. Research and development in this area are ongoing to find cost-effective and durable solutions that can be applied on an industrial scale.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;span&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#option-21-anode-coatings&#34;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;Anode coatings are designed to enhance the selectivity of the Oxygen Evolution Reaction (OER) while suppressing the Chlorine Evolution Reaction (ClER).
&lt;em&gt;The coatings can be applied through various techniques such as thermal decomposition, electroplating, or physical vapor deposition.&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;em&gt;The thickness, morphology, and composition of the coating are critical parameters that determine its effectiveness.&lt;/em&gt;
The aim is to create a surface that has high catalytic activity for water oxidation but a low affinity for chloride ion adsorption, thus preventing chlorine gas production.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;/h5&gt;&lt;p&gt;The paper discusses a method for direct seawater electrolysis for hydrogen production without the need for desalination, aiming to address the shortage of freshwater resources. Seawater must be desalinated before it can be used in proton exchange membrane (PEM) electrolysers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The research introduces an approach where a Lewis Acid Layer with the help of \(Cr_2O_3\) is added to the catalysts. This modification helps to dynamically split water molecules and capture hydroxyl anions, thus generating local alkalinity that improves the kinetics of electrode reactions, avoids chloride attack, and prevents precipitate formation on the electrodes. &lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:4&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:4&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

	&lt;figcaption&gt;Introducing a Lewis Acid Layer (LA) and an Electrical Double Layer (EDL)&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The result is a improvement in system stability and performance, with the electrolysis system reaching over 100 hours of stable operation at 500 mA/cm², and achieving industrially viable current densities at lower voltages, comparable to traditional PEM electrolysers that use purified water. This method circumvents the need for desalination and could potentially tap into the vast reserves of seawater, making it a promising solution for sustainable and large-scale hydrogen production. &lt;sup id=&#34;fnref1:4&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:4&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;span&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#option-22-selective-membranes&#34;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;Selective membranes, such as ion-exchange membranes, are used to separate the anode and cathode compartments, allowing specific ions to pass through. In the case of seawater electrolysis, the membranes would permit the passage of positive ions (cations) and block negative ions (anions), including chloride ions, from reaching the anode. This separation is critical to avoid the formation of chlorine gas. These membranes are not only selective but also have to withstand the harsh oxidative environment at the anode during OER.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;span&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#example-a-membrane-based-seawater-electrolyser-for-hydrogen-generation&#34;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/h5&gt;&lt;p&gt;This study proposes a direct seawater electrolysis method that overcomes the side-reaction and corrosion issues without the need for a pre-desalination process. The authors demonstrate a system that operated stably at a current density of 250 mA/cm² for over 3,200 hours under practical conditions without failure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
	&lt;img src=&#34;./membrane_nature.png&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; height=auto width=&#34;400&#34;/&gt;
	&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This system utilizes a hydrophobic porous polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE)-based waterproof breathable membrane that acts as a critical gas-path interface. This membrane is designed to allow the selective diffusion of water vapor while blocking the passage of liquid seawater and its dissolved impurities, including ions. The use of the membrane facilitates an in situ water purification process, which is essential for the direct electrolysis of seawater. This process is based on a self-driven phase transition mechanism that converts seawater into pure water vapor through spontaneous evaporation, which then diffuses through the membrane. &lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:5&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:5&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;5&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
	&lt;img src=&#34;./bubble.png&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; height=auto width=&#34;400&#34;/&gt;
	&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Self-Dampening Electrolyte (SDE), a concentrated potassium hydroxide (KOH) solution, is another key component of the system. The SDE serves a dual purpose: it functions as the electrolytic medium in which electrolysis occurs, and it maintains the necessary pressure differential across the membrane. As water vapor transits through the membrane from the seawater side, it is absorbed and re-liquefied by the SDE on the other side. This mechanism ensures that pure water is continuously supplied to the electrolyser, thereby sustaining the electrolysis process without the need for external water sources or purification systems. &lt;sup id=&#34;fnref1:5&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:5&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;5&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;

	&lt;figcaption&gt;Constant concentration in the SDE due to the PTFE-membrane&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This innovative setup achieves a new level of efficiency and sustainability in hydrogen production from seawater electrolysis. By establishing a thermodynamic equilibrium where the rate of water migration through the membrane matches the rate of electrolysis, the system maintains a consistent interface pressure difference. The result is a continuous and stable production of hydrogen, with the SDE playing a critical role in regulating the process. This method of direct seawater electrolysis eliminates the need for energy-intensive pre-desalination. &lt;sup id=&#34;fnref2:5&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:5&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;5&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;conclusion&#34;&gt;Conclusion
&lt;span&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#conclusion&#34;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Seawater splitting represents a promising frontier in the pursuit of sustainable hydrogen production. With current technology, it is indeed possible to carry out this process, and we are witnessing successful prototypes and operational models. However, the key to unlocking its full potential lies in scaling up these operations.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>The Beauty and Culture of Taiwan: A Journey Through Time</title>
      <link>https://czyrnik.me/blog/taipei-2023/</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 15 Feb 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://czyrnik.me/blog/taipei-2023/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Taipei, the capital of Taiwan, is known for its unique blend of traditional Chinese culture and a modern, bustling metropolis. Located on the northern tip of the island, Taipei is home to more than 7 million people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;my-first-days-in-taipei&#34;&gt;My first days in Taipei
&lt;span&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#my-first-days-in-taipei&#34;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are many things to do and see in Taipei, from visiting the city&amp;rsquo;s many museums and temples to shopping at the busy night markets. Some of the best things to do in Taipei include exploring the city&amp;rsquo;s famous Ximen shopping district, visiting the iconic Taipei 101 skyscraper, and taking a trip to the nearby Beitou hot springs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;span&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#metro-taipei-mrt&#34;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Taipei&amp;rsquo;s subway system is one of the most efficient in the world. The subway lines are color-coded and easy to navigate, and all signs are in Taiwanese and English, making it a great option for tourists and locals alike.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
	&lt;img src=&#34;./metro_map.jpeg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; height=auto width=&#34;400&#34;/&gt;
	&lt;figcaption&gt;Metro Map of Taipei&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition to the Taipei Metro, the city offers bus and bike-sharing (YouBike) options for those looking for a more environmentally friendly way to travel. The bus network covers a wide area, providing connections to outlying areas and between metro lines.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;population-trend-in-taipei&#34;&gt;Population Trend in Taipei
&lt;span&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#population-trend-in-taipei&#34;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Taipei&amp;rsquo;s population grew rapidly between the 1950s and 1990s, increasing fivefold!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since then, population growth has begun to stagnate due to declining birth rates with a fertility rate of about 1.2 children per woman (2020), well below the replacement level of 2.1. The aging population has become a significant issue in Taiwan, with over 16% of the population aged 65 or older by 2020.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;

	&lt;figcaption&gt;Population in Taipei&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a result of these demographic changes, Taipei faces a number of social and economic challenges. The shrinking workforce is putting pressure on the pension system and causing labor shortages in some industries. The government is implementing various policies to address these issues, such as increasing support for elderly care and encouraging immigration to increase the labor force.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;history-of-taiwan&#34;&gt;History of Taiwan
&lt;span&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#history-of-taiwan&#34;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Taiwan&amp;rsquo;s history dates back to the late 17th century, when the island was inhabited by various indigenous tribes. Portuguese explorers named the island &amp;ldquo;Formosa&amp;rdquo; in the 16th century. In the late 1600s, the Dutch established a colony in the south of the island and the Spanish in the north. After seventeen years of war, the Dutch controlled most of the island. However, both colonial powers were eventually displaced by the Chinese, who claimed Taiwan as part of the Qing Dynasty.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;

	&lt;figcaption&gt;Photo generated with DALL·E 2&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During the First Sino-Japanese War in the late 1800s, Taiwan was ceded to Japan, and the island became a Japanese colony. Under Japanese rule, Taiwan underwent significant modernization and was transformed into a center of commerce and industry. However, this period of colonization was marked by cultural suppression and political repression.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After World War II, Taiwan became an independent state under the rule of the Republic of China. In 1949, the Chinese Civil War ended with the defeat of the Nationalist Party, and the Communist People&amp;rsquo;s Republic of China was established on the mainland. The Nationalists retreated to Taiwan, where they established a government-in-exile and ruled the island as the Republic of China (ROC).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;

	&lt;figcaption&gt;Temple in outer Taipei&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During the second half of the 20th century, Taiwan underwent rapid economic development, becoming one of the &amp;ldquo;Four Asian Tigers&amp;rdquo; along with Hong Kong, South Korea, and Singapore. The island has become a major player in the global economy, and its thriving high-tech industry has earned it the nickname &amp;ldquo;Silicon Island&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite its economic success, Taiwan faces political challenges. The People&amp;rsquo;s Republic of China (mainland China) considers Taiwan to be part of its territory, and the international community is divided on the issue. Nevertheless, Taiwan has developed a robust democracy and has become a thriving and dynamic nation with a rich cultural heritage and a bright future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;electricity-and-energy-sources-of-taiwan&#34;&gt;Electricity and Energy Sources of Taiwan
&lt;span&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#electricity-and-energy-sources-of-taiwan&#34;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Taiwan&amp;rsquo;s electricity is generated from fossil fuels: coal and natural gas. In 2021, coal accounted for about 45% of the country&amp;rsquo;s electricity generation, while natural gas accounted for 36%. Nuclear power accounted for about 10%, while renewable sources such as wind, solar, and hydro accounted for the remaining 9%.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In recent years, Taiwan has taken steps to increase its use of renewable energy. The government has set a goal for renewable energy to account for 20% of the country&amp;rsquo;s electricity generation by 2025. To achieve this, the government has implemented various policies and incentives to encourage the development of renewable energy, such as feed-in tariffs for solar and wind power.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;span&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#economy-of-taiwan&#34;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Taiwan&amp;rsquo;s economy is known for its high-tech industries, such as semiconductors (TSMC), electronics, and information technology. Taiwan is dependent on trade, with exports accounting for about 70 percent of its GDP. The country is a member of the World Trade Organization and has free trade agreements with many countries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;railway-system-of-taiwan&#34;&gt;Railway System of Taiwan
&lt;span&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#railway-system-of-taiwan&#34;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Taiwan Railway System is a comprehensive rail transportation network covering the entire island of Taiwan. It consists of three main types of trains: local trains, express trains, and high-speed trains.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Local trains are the slowest and least expensive, stopping at all stations and serving short distances within a county or city. Express trains are faster and more expensive, stop at fewer stations, and offer more amenities such as more comfortable seats and dining cars.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
	&lt;img src=&#34;./railway.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; height=auto width=&#34;400&#34;/&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The THSRC is the fastest way to travel between major cities in Taiwan. The high-speed rail system, known as the Bullet Train, began service in 2007 and covers the 345-kilometer distance from Taipei to Kaohsiung in 90 minutes. Trains travel at speeds of up to 300 kilometers per hour. 🚅&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Lantern Festival in Taiwan 2023</title>
      <link>https://czyrnik.me/blog/lantern-festival-2023/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 06 Feb 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://czyrnik.me/blog/lantern-festival-2023/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;The Lantern Festival in Taiwan is an important traditional Chinese festival that marks the end of the Lunar New Year celebrations. It is a time when people gather to light and appreciate colorful lanterns, participate in various cultural activities, and enjoy performances and traditional food.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are several places where you can watch the Lantern Festival. I combined the day with a trip to Jiufen and finished with the lantern festival in Pingxi. There&amp;rsquo;s another town called Shifen nearby. I am told you can buy and release lanterns all year round next to the railway.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;pingxi-festival&#34;&gt;Pingxi Festival
&lt;span&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#pingxi-festival&#34;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Pingxi Lantern Festival is a part of the larger Taipei Lantern Festival and takes place annually in the small town of Pingxi since 1999. It&amp;rsquo;s the most famous celebration in Taiwan. The highlight of the festival is the release of sky lanterns, made of paper with a candle or fuel cell inside, which rise into the sky after participants write their wishes on them. People gather in groups and release their lanterns at the same time. The release of sky lanterns is a breathtaking sight, with the sky filled with floating lanterns of different colors and sizes. The festival attracts thousands of visitors each year. It is a celebration of local culture and a time for families and friends to come together.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;jiufen&#34;&gt;Jiufen
&lt;span&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#jiufen&#34;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jiufen is a historic mountain town. Once a prosperous gold mining town during the Japanese colonial period, it is now a popular tourist destination. The town is referred to as the &amp;ldquo;real-life version of Spirited Away&amp;rdquo;, a reference to the Japanese animated film directed by Hayao Miyazaki. The movie&amp;rsquo;s fantastical, labyrinthine setting is said to have been inspired by Jiufen&amp;rsquo;s narrow streets and steep staircases, its traditional tea houses and street vendors. &lt;em&gt;(Hayao denies it.)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;

	&lt;figcaption&gt;Jiufen Teahouse&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition to its architecture, Jiufen is known for its stunning views of the Pacific Ocean and its vibrant night market. The night market offers local food, souvenirs, and street performances, while the town&amp;rsquo;s old-world charm and modern amenities make it a unique travel experience.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Exploring the Beauty and Wilderness of the Swedish Lapland: My Kungsleden Trek 🥾</title>
      <link>https://czyrnik.me/blog/kungsleden-2022/</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 07 Jul 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://czyrnik.me/blog/kungsleden-2022/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;The Kungsleden, or &amp;ldquo;King&amp;rsquo;s Trail&amp;rdquo;, is a 400-km trek through Swedish Lapland that attracts hikers and outdoor enthusiasts from around the world. This trail offers a unique experience that combines breathtaking natural beauty, peaceful solitude, and the chance to immerse yourself in the rugged wilderness of the Arctic Circle both in summer and winter. There are STF-operated &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.swedishtouristassociation.com/stf-mountain-shops-shop-off-beaten-track/&#34;&gt;mountain huts&lt;/a&gt; every 10 to 20 km. You can buy your food and necessities in their stores. You need to find your trade-off between saving weight and spending more than usual. 🎒&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
	&lt;img src=&#34;./map.png&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; height=auto width=&#34;400&#34;/&gt;
	&lt;figcaption&gt;Kungsleden Map&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I recently hiked Kungsleden from south to north and it was an unforgettable experience. My hike started in the small town of Kvikkjokk after a night in Luleå and an early train ride. I started in the middle of June, the beginning of the season. So I avoided the hordes of mosquitoes around Kvikkjokk. 🦟&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
	&lt;img src=&#34;./view_laitaure.jpeg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; height=auto width=&#34;400&#34;/&gt;
	&lt;figcaption&gt;Laitaure&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You are constantly rewarded with breathtaking views of mountains, crystal clear lakes and dense forests of pine and birch trees. The nature changes significantly during the hike. The south is dominated by a &amp;ldquo;sea of trees&amp;rdquo;, while the north is characterized by rocks and clear views into the distance due to the higher elevation. 🏕️&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
	&lt;img src=&#34;./skierfe.jpeg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; height=auto width=&#34;400&#34;/&gt;
	&lt;figcaption&gt;View from the mountain Skierfe&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the highlights of the hike was reaching the top of Skierfe. You can see part of
Sarek National Park from the top. It is the oldest national park in Europe and is known for its rugged and untamed landscapes. The park is home to a wide variety of wildlife, including reindeer, moose and a variety of bird species. 🏔️&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The beauty of this view was incomparable. I will return to the Sarek in the future. This time, I just spend some time to enjoy the beauty of the north. 👀&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
	&lt;img src=&#34;./vakkotavare_teusajaure.jpeg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; height=auto width=&#34;400&#34;/&gt;
	&lt;figcaption&gt;Pass between Vakkotavare and Teusajaure&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A great experience was camping in the remote wilderness. You are allowed to camp almost everywhere - stay away from buildings. 🏠&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was difficult to find dry places because of all the snow melting in June. Once I found a spot for the night, I felt how disconnected I was from the outside world. 🌱&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The silence was broken only by the sounds of nature, such as the wind rustling through the trees and the occasional bird call. It was the perfect opportunity to reflect, recharge, and connect with the natural world. 🤫&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
	&lt;img src=&#34;./near_kaitumjaure.jpeg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; height=auto width=&#34;400&#34;/&gt;
	&lt;figcaption&gt;Near Kaitumjaure&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As I continued north, I met other hikers from all over the world and we shared our experiences, stories, and the conditions ahead. This made the trip even more memorable. 🗣️&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
	&lt;img src=&#34;./camp_after_tjaktja.jpeg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; height=auto width=&#34;400&#34;/&gt;
	&lt;figcaption&gt;Camp after Tjäktja&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the most challenging parts was the mountain pass after Tjäktja. Fellow hikers told me that the pass opened two days before I arrived. There was so much snow! ❄️&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Every few minutes I would break through the snow, not knowing what is underneath me. Sometimes you hear flowing water and hope the snow will hold. 🥶&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Don&amp;rsquo;t walk over blueish snow. That&amp;rsquo;s a sign of a thin layer over running water. ⚠️&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was a rough experience, but eventually I made it to the top and was able to dry my feet. The shelter filled up quickly. But after an hour I left to reach the next place for the night. 🥾&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
	&lt;img src=&#34;./tjäktja_pass.jpeg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; height=auto width=&#34;400&#34;/&gt;
	&lt;figcaption&gt;Tjäktja Mountain Pass&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After about a week, I reached the end of the trail in Abisko, where I could take the train back to civilization and reflect on my journey. The Kungsleden had tested my physical and mental limits, but it gave me a sense of peace and accomplishment that I will always cherish. 🚀&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;itinerary-overview&#34;&gt;Itinerary Overview
&lt;span&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#itinerary-overview&#34;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Day 1: 25 km, Kvikkjokk to Parte&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Day 2: 16 km, Parte to Aktse&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Day 3: 25 km, Aktse to Skierfe to Sitojaure&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Day 4: 16 km, Sitojaure to Saltoluokta&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Day 5: 20 km, Vakkotavare to Kaitumjaure&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Day 6: 22 km, Kaitumjaura to (almost) Sälka&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Day 7: 26 km, Sälka to (almost) Alesjaure&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Day 8: 35 km, Alesjaure to Abisko&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Total: ~185 km&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;lake-crossings&#34;&gt;Lake Crossings
&lt;span&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#lake-crossings&#34;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of the key features of the trail are the numerous lake crossings that provide scenic views. The crossings vary in difficulty and length, from short and easy to long and strenuous. The more challenging crossings require the use of boats. You can read more about &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.swedishtouristassociation.com/boats-in-the-mountains/&#34;&gt;the boats in the mountains&lt;/a&gt;. 🚣&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Do not underestimate the current &amp;amp; wind on the lake. ⚠️&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Please note that all boat traffic must be paid in cash.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Digital Nomad Experience in Riga</title>
      <link>https://czyrnik.me/blog/nomad-riga/</link>

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;welcome-to-the-baltics---riga-edition&#34;&gt;Welcome to the Baltics - Riga Edition
&lt;span&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#welcome-to-the-baltics---riga-edition&#34;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;It was an easy bus ride between Tallinn and Riga. My Airbnb was near the main railway station, a few minutes walk. Riga felt more chaotic than Tallinn for the first few minutes. There are more people, cars and buses. 🚎&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;old-town&#34;&gt;Old Town
&lt;span&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#old-town&#34;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Riga&amp;rsquo;s Old Town is a UNESCO World Heritage Site. The cobbled streets are lined with medieval buildings, many of which have been beautifully restored.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
	&lt;img src=&#34;./old_town.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; height=auto width=&#34;400&#34;/&gt;
	&lt;figcaption&gt;Old Town Vibes by Jacques Bopp&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the main highlights of the Old Town is the Town Hall Square, which is home to the impressive Riga Town Hall. This Gothic-style building was built in the 14th century and now houses the Riga City Council. The Town Hall Square is surrounded by other notable buildings, such as the House of the Blackheads and the St. Peter&amp;rsquo;s Church. You can take a guided tour of the Town Hall to learn more about its history and architecture.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;

	&lt;figcaption&gt;Town Hall Square by Martin Kleppe&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The St. Peter&amp;rsquo;s Church is one of the largest medieval churches in the Baltic region. Built in the 13th century, it is a mixture of Gothic and Baroque styles. You can take a guided tour of the cathedral to learn more about its history and admire its impressive stained glass windows and frescoes. 🔔&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;

	&lt;figcaption&gt;St. Peter&#39;s Church by Artem Makarov&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Old Town is a great place to explore on foot. You can stroll along the cobbled streets and admire the colorful buildings and street art. The Old Town is full of shops, cafes and restaurants where you can enjoy traditional Latvian food and drinks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;vegan-community&#34;&gt;Vegan Community
&lt;span&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#vegan-community&#34;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Riga has a thriving vegan community, with several restaurants and cafes catering to this lifestyle. Many of these places offer delicious and healthy food options, such as salads, smoothies, and raw desserts. 💚&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
	&lt;img src=&#34;./kozy_eats.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; height=auto width=&#34;400&#34;/&gt;
	&lt;figcaption&gt;Kozy Eats by Kozy Eats&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think it is less common to be vegan in Riga. I cooked a lot during my stay. 👨‍🍳&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;population&#34;&gt;Population
&lt;span&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#population&#34;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;After the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991, Latvia regained its independence and began the process of transition to a market economy. This led to significant changes in the demographics of the city&amp;rsquo;s population.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the 1990s, Riga&amp;rsquo;s population declined due to emigration, mainly of the Russian-speaking population. The city&amp;rsquo;s population fell from around 900,000 in the early 1990s to around 700,000 in the late 1990s. This trend was driven by the economic and political instability in the country during this period and the desire of many Russian-speaking residents to return to their home country.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
	&lt;img src=&#34;./Riga_plot.png&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; height=auto width=&#34;400&#34;/&gt;
	&lt;figcaption&gt;Population Trend in Riga&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The city&amp;rsquo;s economy improved and more people moved to the city to work and study. EU accession in 2004 helped to attract more investment and business opportunities to Riga. Outside the city centre, many commercial spaces are unoccupied. Walking through the outer streets can sometimes feel sad.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The streets are full of cars, even though the city has lost almost a third of its population. It&amp;rsquo;s always busy in Riga.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;public-transport&#34;&gt;Public Transport
&lt;span&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#public-transport&#34;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Riga has a well-developed public transport system that includes buses, trams and trolleybuses. Buses run frequently and can take you to most destinations in Riga. The tram system has several lines running through the city centre and suburbs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Public transport in Riga is affordable, with a one-way ticket costing around two euros (valid for one hour) and a day ticket costing around four euros (valid for 24 hours).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you are travelling by train, you can use the official app (Pasažieru vilciens) to buy your tickets. The stations outside the city can be minimalist though. 😊&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
	&lt;img src=&#34;./beach_train.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; height=auto width=&#34;400&#34;/&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;beach&#34;&gt;Beach
&lt;span&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#beach&#34;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Riga&amp;rsquo;s beach is not the most popular among tourists, but it is worth a visit. The beach is located in Jurmala, a coastal town about 30 minutes from the city centre. 🚂&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I enjoyed taking the train from Riga Central Station to one of the stops along the beach. Personally, time on the beach gives me an instant holiday feeling. 🤓&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The beach is long and wide, with fine white sand and clear blue water. There are many beach bars and restaurants serving delicious food and drinks. It is the perfect place to relax and enjoy the sun and sea. ☀️&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;parks&#34;&gt;Parks
&lt;span&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#parks&#34;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Riga has several beautiful parks, perfect for a relaxing stroll or a picnic. The largest and most popular park is Mežaparks, located on the banks of the Daugava River. The park has a lake, a playground and several monuments. Another popular park is Esplanade Park, located in the heart of the city, with a music pavilion, fountain and several statues. The park is a great place to relax and enjoy the fresh air. There are many other small parks and gardens throughout the city, such as the Riga Botanical Garden and Ziedoņdārzs Park.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I used to go to the park on hot, sunny days. Combined with a light breeze, it&amp;rsquo;s the perfect summer day in the city.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;conclusion&#34;&gt;Conclusion
&lt;span&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#conclusion&#34;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Riga is a beautiful and affordable city. My favorite place in Riga was the beach.I&amp;rsquo;d prefer Tallinn to Riga. Although Riga is the bigger city with more opportunities.🙃&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Remote Studying and Working in Tallinn</title>
      <link>https://czyrnik.me/blog/nomad-tallinn/</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 01 Jun 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://czyrnik.me/blog/nomad-tallinn/</guid>
      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;welcome-to-the-baltics&#34;&gt;Welcome to the Baltics
&lt;span&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#welcome-to-the-baltics&#34;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yes, I chose Tallinn as the first destination as a digital nomad. Tallinn - the tiny capital many never heard of. I think it&amp;rsquo;s one of the most underrated cities in Europe. 🇪🇺&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Estonia is the country with the most digital government in Europe. Their ID cards provide digital access for signatures, voting, medical records and submitting tax claims. You can even start your first business digitally. But there are things you need to do in person: marriage, divorce and a credit for properties.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;IT education is important in Estonia. All children start learning about algorithms and coding at the age of seven. It&amp;rsquo;s designed to be preparation for the digital age.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
	&lt;img src=&#34;./Old town Entrance.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; height=auto width=&#34;400&#34;/&gt;
	&lt;figcaption&gt;Small Street in Tallinn Old Town by 66 north&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fun Fact: When you walk around the city, you&amp;rsquo;ll notice the lokal coffeeshops &amp;ldquo;Reval&amp;rdquo;. That&amp;rsquo;s the original name of the city until 1918. The name changed to Tallinn with the independence of Estonia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reval was a significant trade hub in Europe during the 14th and 16th centuries. Today, the old town of Tallinn is one of the best-preserved medieval cities and is classified as a UNESCO World Heritage Site. You get a glimpse of the former medieval fortress.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tallinn was occupied by the German until end of World War 1. Followed by the occupation by the Red Army during World War 2 in 1940. Nazi Germany occupied the city from 1941 to 1944. But Soviet occupation was quickly reestablished until 1991. Tallinn became the capital of an independent country once again in August 1991. 🎉&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;population&#34;&gt;Population
&lt;span&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#population&#34;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tallinn experienced an extensive influx of Russian immigrants during the Soviet occupation (1944-1991). Whole new city districts were developed like Lasnamäe,T which became the most populous district of Tallinn in the 1980s. &lt;em&gt;Today, about 50 % of the inhabits speak Estonian and about 46 % speak Russian as their native language.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;old-town&#34;&gt;Old Town
&lt;span&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#old-town&#34;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;I was lucky to live in the middle of the city. My apartment was next to the town hall square. Many tourists arrive by ferry and bus for day trips. Consequently, the streets can get crowded. But the early mornings and late nights are comparatively quiet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Interestingly, the Russian embassy was always guarded by at least one Estonian police car. Estonias do support the Ukrainians in the war. 🇺🇦&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
	&lt;img src=&#34;./embassy.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; height=auto width=&#34;400&#34;/&gt;
	&lt;figcaption&gt;Posters in front of the Russian embassy&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Old Town felt like a car-free zone to me. There are just very little parking slots in the centre. There&amp;rsquo;s no traffic lights for pedestrians between Old Town and Telliskivi. You can cross one of Tallinn main roads with an underpass. I did enjoy never stopping to get to work!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;telliskivi&#34;&gt;Telliskivi
&lt;span&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#telliskivi&#34;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;I spent most of my time in Telliskivi. It&amp;rsquo;s the home of the rising tech and startup scene in Tallinn. There are many (vegan) restaurants to choose for you lunch dates. There&amp;rsquo;s are unique style, which attracts likeminded people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
	&lt;img src=&#34;./Telliskivi.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; height=auto width=&#34;400&#34;/&gt;
	&lt;figcaption&gt;Graffiti in Telliskivi&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;coworking-space-lift99-&#34;&gt;Coworking Space Lift99 🚀
&lt;span&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#coworking-space-lift99-&#34;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lift99 is one of the popular coworking spaces in Tallinn. I liked their idea leaving your shoes at the entrance to change into slippers. Their staffs is always easy to reach and coordinates the weekly/monthly social events for the community. Tea and Coffee are available for all and the internet connection is fast and reliable. I&amp;rsquo;ll come back to this place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;public-transport&#34;&gt;Public Transport
&lt;span&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#public-transport&#34;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;I used the public transport to get to the city after I arrived at the airport. Super easy, super affordable, there&amp;rsquo;s a tram line which connects the city with the airport. You can buy your ticket as a QR code. These QR codes are scanned at front entry of the tram or bus. All the transport is free for residents though. Theirs smart card functions as validation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;vegan-community&#34;&gt;Vegan Community
&lt;span&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#vegan-community&#34;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;I was surprised by the many options for vegans in the city. My favourite restaurant is the &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.veganrestoran.ee/en&#34;&gt;VEGAN RESTORAN V&lt;/a&gt;. They have small place in the centre of Old Town. Their menu is suitable for everyone, you&amp;rsquo;ll find something. The self-made cakes and smoothies are as tasty as the main courses. Full recommendation. 😍&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
	&lt;img src=&#34;./restaurant.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; height=auto width=&#34;400&#34;/&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;beach&#34;&gt;Beach
&lt;span&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#beach&#34;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once you left Old Town, it&amp;rsquo;s pretty flat everywhere. I enjoyed having a short run to beach and watching the sunset. ☀️&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
	&lt;img src=&#34;./beach.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; height=auto width=&#34;400&#34;/&gt;
	&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;things-to-do&#34;&gt;Things to Do:
&lt;span&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#things-to-do&#34;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&#34;https://meremuuseum.ee/lennusadam/en/&#34;&gt;Lennusadam&lt;/a&gt; represents a part of the marine warfare of Tallinn. I walked in a submarine, learned about different types of sea mines and got a general overview of vessels throughout history.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
	&lt;img src=&#34;./museum.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; height=auto width=&#34;400&#34;/&gt;
	&lt;figcaption&gt;Lennusadam Seaplane Harbour Museum&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have a thing for photography. Visiting the &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.fotografiska.com/tallinn/en/&#34;&gt;Fotografiska&lt;/a&gt; in Tallinn was a must-see for me. You get through quick quickly but the admission fee was worth it for me. I was astonished the mastery of photography as art can look like. The exhibitions change in every Fotografiska over the year. There&amp;rsquo;s always something new to discover. 📸&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
	&lt;img src=&#34;./Fotografika.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; height=auto width=&#34;400&#34;/&gt;
	&lt;figcaption&gt;Photo in Fotografiska&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An other museum you could visit are the &lt;a href=&#34;https://kumu.ekm.ee/en/&#34;&gt;Kumu&lt;/a&gt;. If nature is more your thing, have a look at the Jägala waterfall and the national park Lahemaa.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;conclusion&#34;&gt;Conclusion
&lt;span&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#conclusion&#34;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;I did fall in love with Tallinn. It&amp;rsquo;s a small city which offers everything I could wish for. The long sun hours in June are perfect for long evenings and fantastical experiences in the city.&lt;/p&gt;

      <pubDate>Mon, 02 May 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://czyrnik.me/blog/starting-a-life-as-digital-nomad/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Selling almost all your shit, renting Airbnbs for the upcoming months, saying goodbye to your social circle - sounds familiar? Leave your comfort zone, they said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
    &lt;img src=&#34;./challenge_accepted.png&#34;&#34; alt=&#34;Challenge Accepted&#34; height=auto width=&#34;400&#34;/&gt;
    &lt;figcaption&gt;Get on with it!&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;starting-a-life-as-digital-nomad&#34;&gt;Starting a Life as Digital Nomad
&lt;span&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#starting-a-life-as-digital-nomad&#34;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;But why the heck should you leave everything behind and sell your shit? Simple. Flexibility, independence and the sense of adventure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is incredible, when you can call any place your home! But eventually, someone asks you for the first time: &amp;ldquo;Hey, what are you doing for a living?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That feels weird. How do you explain, what you&amp;rsquo;re trying to accomplish right now? &amp;ldquo;I live out of a suitcase and do things on a computer remotely.&amp;rdquo; That&amp;rsquo;s right-on, but neither concrete nor creative. Going into detail on all the online adventures I&amp;rsquo;m having was not the ideal way to answer that question. 🙃&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The next follow-up question &amp;ldquo;Where are you living?&amp;rdquo; becomes awkwardly difficult&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
    &lt;img src=&#34;./freedom.png&#34;&#34; alt=&#34;Freedom Everywhere&#34; height=auto width=&#34;400&#34;/&gt;
    &lt;figcaption&gt;Freedom!&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Being independent of a fixed location is a privileged lifestyle. You do not need to be a highly educated tech person for it, but it is advantageous being one. It&amp;rsquo;s easy to stay within an English-speaking bubble. There is not much of a change. I do appreciate the privilege of being born into a high income country in the middle of Europe more than I used to! Let&amp;rsquo;s see what the upcoming weeks will add to that!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;what-am-i-expecting-from-the-upcoming-months&#34;&gt;What am I expecting from the upcoming months?
&lt;span&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#what-am-i-expecting-from-the-upcoming-months&#34;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;I started to get rid of unnecessary possessions a couple of years ago. Ever since, I’ve been trying to own less and focus more on experiences. Going even more digital is the next step of my journey to &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Essentialism&#34;&gt;essentialism&lt;/a&gt;. I want to deepen my understanding of central things in life, at least in my own comprehension. Leaving your typical surroundings can be a great kick-start for exciting  changes! 🚀&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;figcaption&gt;U Can&#39;t Touch This 🎵&lt;/figcaption&gt;

&lt;span&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#remote-student-life&#34;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Starting a digital lifestyle as a student is one of the best starting points. It&amp;rsquo;s one of the most flexible periods in life, anyways. Getting to know new people feels easy and natural!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are nearly no serious obstacles to overcome. Most of the study materials are available online. You need to find a table and an internet connection - that&amp;rsquo;s a piece of cake! The Erasmus Student Network (ESN) is one of many ways to get to know new people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, exams still require attendance. So, there are some weeks in the year, which are bound to a specific location.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;span&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#conclusion&#34;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m excited about the next weeks and months! Many new experiences, memories and friendships will be made.&lt;/p&gt;
